# PyRDA

Remote Desktop Application implementation in Python

Allows you to control computers connected to your network using browser as the controlling client. It sets up a tornado server on the victim's system then allows it to be controlled by receiving commands from the web client and executing them using **pyautogui**

## Setting Up
* Install Python3 and the project's dependencies
* Fire up `server.py` on the computer you wish to control
* Open the given IP address on the client browser and you have full control over the desired system

## TODO
* Make client available outside the network
* Add some sweet functionality like stealing saved passwords, stealing clipboard data, running system commands, webcam & microphone access
